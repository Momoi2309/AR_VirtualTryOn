# AR_VirtualTryOn
Augmented Reality Virtual Try-On for various accessories like watches and glasses

Personal Project where I integrated an Unity Project that has the main AR functionality, into Android Native.
The AR app uses both cameras of a mobile device to place the desired 3D models of the accessories on the detected user's face/hand.
